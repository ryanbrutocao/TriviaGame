Trivia Game for homework 5

This was a homework assignement. 
-There were two areas of struggle for me- first was the adding of the scores. I had a difficult time getting it to count up the answered vs unanswered vs correct. I was able to resolve this through checking the value of the answer vs the data val of the answer chosen. It tooko me a while to get this figured out.

Another area that I really struggled was with the buttons/answers. It took me a bit to figure out that radio buttons were what I should be using. For the time allowed on this homework I was unable to format the answers how I wanted, but did manage to get everything on the page and properly working.
